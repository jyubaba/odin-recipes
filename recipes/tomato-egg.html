        <p>Great to eat for dinner and save for leftovers for a hearty meal the next day :)</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>4 ripe tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>2 cups of white rice</li>
            <li>minced garlic</li>
            <li>soy sauce</li>
            <li>fish sauce</li>
            <li>black pepper</li>
            <li>chopped green onions</li>
            <li>onion powder</li>
            <li>avocado oil</li>
            <li><em>(Optional)</em> diced spam</li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and start cooking your rice.</li>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a small bowl and beat for about 30 seconds before setting aside.</li>
            <li>Dice the tomatoes into smaller pieces and set aside.</li>
            <li>Grab a frying pan and put on medium heat. Once it's hot enough, pour the eggs in. Stir and cook until 80% cooked before putting it back into the small bowl and setting aside.</li>
            <li>Add 1 teaspoon of black pepper on top of the semi-cooked eggs.</li>
            <li>Using the same pan, turn the heat to high and add garlic and the diced tomatoes. Make sure to smash and squish the tomatoes for extra sauce.</li>
            <li>Add two splashes of fish sauce and three splashes of soy sauce. Next, sprinkle some onion powder and mix.</li>
            <li>Once the tomatoes have become soft and mushy, add your egg back in along with green onions (and optional spam).</li>
            <li>Cook for 2 more minutes on high and then turn off. Move it to a not hot surface.</li>
            <li>Serve with rice. Save extras with leftover rice for meal prep.</li>
        </ol>
